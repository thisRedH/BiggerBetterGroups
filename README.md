# BiggerBetterGroups (BBG)

BiggerBetterGroups is a small WhatsApp Bot, using [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js).
It aims to make WhatsApp groups bigger by combining multiple groups together.

Note: As statet by [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js#whatsapp-webjs):
> I can't guarantee you will not be blocked by using this method, although it has worked for me. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe.
